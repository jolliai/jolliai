# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and others) when working with code in this repository. It is the single source of truth; `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Critical rules

These rules affect whether a change can ship at all. They override any other guidance below.

- **DCO sign-off on every commit** — `git commit -s`. CI rejects PRs without `Signed-off-by:`.
- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer or `🤖 Generated with …` footer.** Commit messages and PR descriptions stay human-authored; only the DCO `Signed-off-by:` trailer belongs there.
- **`npm run all` must pass before commit** (clean → build → lint → test). CI runs the same chain.
- **Do not regress CLI test coverage.** New code under `cli/src/` is held to 97% statements / 96% branches / 97% functions / 97% lines (see [`cli/vite.config.ts`](cli/vite.config.ts)).
- **Three implementations of the API key parser stay in lockstep.** `parseJolliApiKey` / `assertJolliOriginAllowed` live in [`cli/src/core/JolliApiUtils.ts`](cli/src/core/JolliApiUtils.ts), are bundled into the VS Code extension verbatim, and have a Kotlin port in `intellij/`. Updating one without the others is a known-bad pattern.
- **Cross-package imports in `vscode/src/**` are intentional.** Paths like `../../../cli/src/core/JolliApiUtils.js` resolve at esbuild bundle time. Don't refactor them into a published-package import — VS Code currently bundles the CLI inline.
- **Worktree-aware code only.** Hooks, summary storage, and lock files must work across `git worktree` checkouts. Don't assume a single working tree.
- **Suspected vulnerabilities go through [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)**, not public issues or PRs.
- **Workflow injection hygiene.** Inside `.github/workflows/*.yaml`, any `${{ … }}` expression derived from a user-controlled context — `github.event.*`, `inputs.*`, `github.head_ref`, the commit author/message fields, etc. — must be funnelled through `env:` before reaching a `run:` block or the `with:` of an untrusted action. Direct interpolation is the injection pattern. The existing publish workflows already follow this for both `inputs.tag` and `github.event.release.tag_name`.

## Repository layout

Monorepo with three deliverables that share the same product model and storage. By default (0.99.0+) every memory is dual-written to **both** the git orphan branch `jollimemory/summaries/v3` (system of record) and the user-pickable **Memory Bank** folder on disk. The Memory Bank folder has two layers: a hidden `<localFolder>/<repo>/.jolli/` directory holding canonical JSON (`summaries/<hash>.json`, `transcripts/<hash>.json`, `index.json`) for programmatic access, and a visible `<localFolder>/<repo>/<branch>/<slug>-<hash8>.md` layer holding human-browsable Markdown for the user. Reads come from the orphan branch:

- `cli/` — `@jolli.ai/cli` (npm workspace, Node 22.5+, ESM, Vite multi-entry lib build). Standalone command-line tool plus all git/agent hook scripts.
- `vscode/` — `jollimemory-vscode` extension (npm workspace, esbuild → CJS). Bundles the CLI and hook scripts into its own `dist/` so it has **no dependency on a global CLI install**.
- `intellij/` — separate Gradle/Kotlin project (JDK 21). Independent build, but installs the same git/agent hooks and writes to the same shared state: the orphan branch, the Memory Bank folder, the machine-global `~/.jolli/jollimemory/` (config + hook entry scripts), and the per-project `<projectDir>/.jolli/jollimemory/` (sessions, cursors, queue, …).

Root `package.json` only coordinates the two npm workspaces; it does not touch `intellij/`. Use `.nvmrc` (currently `24.10.0`) for the Node version.

**Names you'll see (all refer to the same product):**

- **`jollimemory`** — product name; orphan branch prefix (`jollimemory/summaries/v3`).
- **`jolliai`** — current GitHub org / repo namespace (`github.com/jolliai/jolliai`).
- **`@jolli.ai/cli`** — npm scope and package name for the CLI workspace.
- **`jollimemory-vscode`** — `package.json` `name` of the VS Code extension. Root npm scripts reference it via the **workspace path** `vscode` (e.g. `npm run test -w vscode`), not by package name.

## Common commands

From the repo root (npm workspace; coordinates `cli` + `vscode`):

```bash
npm install            # install workspaces
npm run build          # build cli, then vscode (vscode esbuild bundle inlines cli/src/**)
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit in both
npm run lint           # biome check --error-on-warnings (tab indent, 120 line width)
npm run lint:fix       # biome check --write
npm run test           # vitest run --coverage in both (cli enforces 97% threshold)
npm run all            # clean → build → lint → test (use this before committing)
```

Per-workspace variants exist for every script: `npm run build:cli`, `npm run test:vscode`, `npm run typecheck:cli`, etc.

Running a single test (Vitest):

```bash
# cli — vitest is the test script directly
npm run test -w @jolli.ai/cli -- src/core/SummaryStore.test.ts -t "merges children"

# vscode — same flags, but tests are launched via scripts/run-vitest.mjs
npm run test:vscode -- src/services/JolliPushService.test.ts -t "rejects http"
```

Iterating on the CLI without rebuilding: `npm run cli -- <command>` (uses `tsx` on the source). For end-to-end testing of the actual built artifact, do `cd cli && npm run build && npm install -g .` once — the global symlink keeps pointing to local `dist/`, so subsequent `npm run build` runs are picked up immediately by the global `jolli` binary.

VS Code extension iteration: `cd vscode && npm run deploy` bumps patch version → builds → packages → installs the VSIX. Then **Developer: Reload Window** in VS Code. If you also changed `cli/src/**`, run `cd cli && npm run build` first because the extension bundles the CLI at build time.

IntelliJ plugin: `cd intellij && ./gradlew build` (or `runIde` for a sandbox). See [`intellij/DEVELOPMENT.md`](intellij/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Architecture you can't infer from one file

### Two-layer hook model

The product is built on a hook pipeline that runs in the user's project, not in this repo:

1. **AI agent hooks** (Claude `StopHook` / `SessionStartHook`, Gemini `AfterAgent`) only record session metadata to `<projectDir>/.jolli/jollimemory/sessions.json`. They do not read transcripts, do not call the LLM, and run with `async: true` so they never block the agent. Codex, OpenCode, Cursor (Composer), GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot Chat, Devin CLI, and Antigravity have **no hook** — each has a per-source detector + session discoverer + transcript reader triplet under `cli/src/core/` that runs at post-commit time. The OpenCode reader uses Node 22.5+ `node:sqlite` and is lazy-imported + feature-gated so the VSCode bundle (which targets Node 18) tolerates the missing module; the Cursor, Copilot, Devin, and Antigravity triplets follow the same lazy-import pattern. Devin CLI reads its global WAL SQLite (`~/.local/share/devin/cli/sessions.db`), scoping sessions by the `working_directory` column; its `message_nodes` table is a **forest** (alternate regenerations are sibling nodes), so the canonical conversation is the main chain walked from `sessions.main_chain_id` up the `parent_node_id` pointers — its detection is colocated in `DevinSessionDiscoverer.ts` (OpenCode-style) rather than a separate detector file. Antigravity is the odd one out: its per-conversation SQLite (`~/.gemini/<variant>/conversations/<id>.db`) is read only to recover the workspace path (its own agent data is encrypted), while the conversation *content* is read from a sibling plaintext `brain/<id>/.system_generated/logs/transcript_full.jsonl`. Copilot CLI and Copilot Chat share a single `copilotEnabled` config flag — splitting them was rejected because users want them together. Codex additionally extracts Linear/Jira/GitHub/Notion **references** on the VS Code sidebar's 60s Active Conversations tick (not just summaries at post-commit): [`CodexDiscovery.discoverCodexConversations`](cli/src/core/CodexDiscovery.ts) reuses the shared per-source envelope parser ([`TranscriptEnvelopeParser`](cli/src/core/references/TranscriptEnvelopeParser.ts) → `CodexEnvelopeParser`) and the same `discovery-cursors.json` cursor as the Claude Stop path. References were Claude-StopHook-only before; the envelope layer is now source-agnostic.

2. **Git hooks** drive a unified queue under `.jolli/jollimemory/git-op-queue/`. `post-commit` enqueues + spawns a detached `QueueWorker` in <5 ms; when the commit comes from an interactive context (a TTY or an AI-agent session — `CLAUDECODE`/`AI_AGENT`/`CURSOR_TRACE_ID`/`GEMINI_CLI`/`OPENCODE`), it then tails the worker's `capture-progress/<hash>.ndjson` stream and prints milestones inline, blocking until the worker emits a terminal event, the watch times out (15 s agent ceiling / 90 s TTY), or the worker is detected dead via its per-hash PID lock (`capture-progress/<sha256>.lock`, written by `acquireCaptureLock` in the worker, probed by `isCaptureWorkerDead` in the watcher). GUI git clients set none of these markers and keep the original fast, silent, non-blocking behavior. The worker holds a 5-min file lock, drains entries in timestamp order, runs the LLM where needed, and chain-spawns a successor if new entries appear after it finishes. Squash entries (and rebase-squash) now go through the LLM-driven `generateSquashConsolidation` pipeline (`cli/src/hooks/QueueWorker.ts runSquashPipeline`) — the old "skip LLM, mechanical merge only" behavior is now the **fallback** when the consolidation call fails. Rebase-pick entries skip the LLM and just migrate hashes 1:1. `prepare-commit-msg` writes `squash-pending.json` so the worker recognizes squash before picking a consolidation strategy. See [`cli/DEVELOPMENT.md`](cli/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the queue rationale (each op gets its own file precisely because the previous single-slot pending files lost summaries during rapid amend/rebase sequences).

### Storage: orphan branch + pluggable `StorageProvider` + two `.jolli/jollimemory/` dirs

Summaries live on the git orphan branch `jollimemory/summaries/v3` in the user's repo and are written via plumbing only — the branch is **never checked out**. Read with `git show <branch>:<path>`; write with `hash-object` + `mktree` + `commit-tree` + `update-ref`.

The orphan branch I/O is wrapped behind a `StorageProvider` interface (`cli/src/core/StorageProvider.ts`). Three backends ship today, picked by `StorageFactory` and swapped in at runtime via `setActiveStorage()` in `SummaryStore.ts`:

- `OrphanBranchStorage` — orphan-branch-only, the legacy mode (the only mode in 0.98.0 and earlier).
- `FolderStorage` — folder-only.
- `DualWriteStorage` — **the default in 0.99.0** (`storageMode` defaults to `"dual-write"` in `StorageFactory.createStorage`). Writes go to both the orphan branch (system of record) and the Memory Bank folder. `<localFolder>` is the user's `localFolder` config — one Memory Bank root can host multiple repos, each in its own `<repo>/` subfolder. The folder has two layers (FolderStorage docstring is the source of truth):
  - Hidden `<localFolder>/<repo>/.jolli/` — canonical JSON for programmatic access: `summaries/<commitHash>.json`, `transcripts/<commitHash>.json`, `plans/...`, `notes/...`, `index.json`, `shadow-status.json`.
  - Visible `<localFolder>/<repo>/<branch>/...` — human-browsable Markdown auto-generated from the JSON: `<slug>-<hash8>.md` for summaries, `plan--<slug>.md` for plans, plus visible note copies. The slug is derived from the commit message via `FolderStorage.slugify()`.

  Reads come from the orphan branch (the visible Markdown layer is generated, never read back).

  **Code-side note:** the `kbRoot` variable in `KBPathResolver` / `FolderStorage` is the return value of `resolveKBPath(repoName, remoteUrl, customPath)` — already concatenated to `<localFolder>/<repoName>`, i.e. **already includes** the `<repo>` segment. So in code, `kbRoot` = per-repo path; in user-facing docs the path is written `<localFolder>/<repo>/...`. Same disk location, different naming layers. The `KB`-prefixed module names (`KBPathResolver`, `KBTypes`) and the `kbRoot` variable are legacy identifiers from when the feature was internally called "Knowledge Base"; the user-facing label is "Memory Bank".

The VS Code extension's `activate()` (and the IntelliJ plugin's equivalent) checks `MetadataManager.readMigrationState()` on every start: if the orphan branch has data but migration has not completed (fresh install, or the user wiped the folder), `MigrationEngine.runMigration()` runs automatically. There is no opt-in — Memory Bank is on by default. The Settings → **Memory Bank** tab is the user-facing entry point for re-targeting the folder; clicking **Migrate to Memory Bank** re-runs migration into a fresh `-N`-suffixed folder and archives the previous folder's repo identity (content files are untouched).

Display and write paths in `SummaryStore.ts` / `LocalSearchProvider.ts` go through the active provider, so adding a fourth backend (e.g. SQLite, S3) is a single new class plus a factory wiring change. Existing code that hard-coded git plumbing is gone — don't reintroduce it.

Local non-summary state is split across **two** `.jolli/jollimemory/` directories — don't conflate them:

- `~/.jolli/jollimemory/` — **machine-global**: `config.json` (authToken / apiKey), `dist-paths/` (per-source dist-path indirection), `run-hook` / `run-cli` / `resolve-dist-path` hook entry scripts. Resolved by `getGlobalConfigDir()`.
- `<projectDir>/.jolli/jollimemory/` — **per-project, gitignored**: `sessions.json`, `cursors.json`, `git-op-queue/`, `notes/`, `plans.json`, `briefing-cache.json`, `space-binding.json` (cached repo→Space binding, 7 d TTL — see `SpaceBindingCache.ts`), and `debug.log`. Resolved by `getJolliMemoryDir(cwd)` in [`cli/src/Logger.ts`](cli/src/Logger.ts). One sibling here, `profile.json`, is deliberately **repo-wide, not per-worktree**: [`RepoProfile`](cli/src/core/RepoProfile.ts) anchors it to the **main** worktree root (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`) so it is shared across every worktree. It holds `backfillDismissed` and the **CLI-owned `manuallyDisabled`** opt-out — a durable, highest-priority disable that `jolli disable` and the VS Code Disable command set, that only an explicit re-enable clears, and that upgrades / window reloads must never override. `ManualDisableFlag.ts` in the VS Code extension is a thin re-export of the `RepoProfile` helpers, and reads migrate the legacy per-worktree `disabled-by-user` markers.

### VS Code extension bundles the CLI

`vscode/esbuild.config.mjs` produces two CJS bundles in `dist/`: `Extension.js` (with `vscode` external) and `Cli.js` plus each hook script (`PostCommitHook.js`, `StopHook.js`, …). Both bundles inline modules from `cli/src/**` directly. Consequences:

- VS Code source frequently imports across packages with paths like `../../../cli/src/core/JolliApiUtils.js` — these resolve at bundle time. Don't try to "clean these up" into a published-package import.
- `import.meta.url` in `cli/src/install/Installer.ts` is replaced with a real `__filename` expression by esbuild so the Installer can locate hook scripts relative to the bundle at runtime.
- jollimemory core is pure ESM, but the VS Code extension host requires CJS — esbuild handles the bridging.

Hook installation uses dist-path indirection: hooks call `node "$($HOME/.jolli/jollimemory/resolve-dist-path)/PostCommitHook.js"`, where `resolve-dist-path` reads the `~/.jolli/jollimemory/dist-path` file. CLI vs extension write the same version-tagged dist-path (e.g. `source=cli@1.0.0\n/abs/path/to/dist`), so whichever surface was enabled most recently wins, and version comparisons work across surfaces.

**Source soft-prefer (Claude Code plugin).** Every install source competes on version — there is no hard pin. When `JOLLI_DIST_PREFER_SOURCE=<source>` is set, `resolve-dist-path` picks `dist-paths/<source>` **only** when it is present, complete (`has_required`), and already at the top version `BEST_VER` — so it wins a version **tie** ahead of the global `SOURCE_PREFERENCE_ORDER`, but a strictly-higher-version source still wins, and a missing / incomplete / older prefer falls through to the normal Pass 1 / Pass 2 cross-source logic (never `exit 1`). The plugin's git-hooks-only install soft-prefers the source it just registered (`sourceTag`, i.e. `claude-plugin`) on every git hook — via `buildHookCommand`'s `preferSource` arg for post-commit/-merge/-rewrite/prepare-commit-msg and an inline prefix in `GitHookInstaller.ts` for pre-push — and the plugin's `init`/`login`/`logout`/`recall`/`search`/`status` recipes set the same env on their `run-cli` calls. The plugin MCP server + agent hooks still launch `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/*` directly (per-host, not shared cross-source resources), so those never resolve through this at all. `SOURCE_PREFERENCE_ORDER` (TS `DistPathResolver.ts` ↔ the `for pref in …` list in the `resolve-dist-path` shell template) stays `["cli","vscode","cursor"]` — `claude-plugin` is deliberately NOT added to it; the per-invocation soft-prefer is what expresses "this client, this call." At git-hook trigger time the invoking client is unknown, so a hook's baked prefer degrades to "last `enable` wins" (acceptable — the plugin re-runs `enable --git-hooks-only` on every SessionStart). This replaced an earlier hard `JOLLI_DIST_SOURCE` pin (resolve-only-that-source-or-fail); do not reintroduce it.

### MCP server registration (multi-host)

`jolli enable` wires the `jolli mcp` stdio server into every detected AI host. Registration is handled by per-host `McpHostRegistrar` implementations under [`cli/src/install/mcp/HostRegistrars.ts`](cli/src/install/mcp/HostRegistrars.ts). Each registrar carries a `scope`: **repo**-scoped hosts (config inside the worktree) are registered per-worktree via `registerRepoMcpHosts`; **global**-scoped hosts (one machine-wide file shared by every repo) are registered once via `registerGlobalMcpHosts`. Uninstall calls `removeRepoMcpHosts` — global entries are deliberately **not** removed, since a single-repo uninstall must not break MCP for other repos still using Jolli. Seven hosts are supported:

| Host | Scope | Config path | Writer |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Claude Code | repo | `.mcp.json` in the project root | `registerMcpInClaude` (custom merge — preserves other servers) |
| Cursor | repo | `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project root | `JsonMcpWriter` |
| Gemini CLI | global | `~/.gemini/settings.json` | `JsonMcpWriter` |
| Codex | global | `~/.codex/config.toml` | `CodexTomlWriter` (hand-written TOML — no external TOML lib) |
| OpenCode | global | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | `JsonMcpWriter` (key `mcp`; entry needs `type:"local"` + combined command array) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | global | `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` | `JsonMcpWriter` |
| VS Code Copilot Chat | global | `<vscodeUserDataDir>/User/mcp.json` | `JsonMcpWriter` (key `servers`; entry `type:"stdio"`) |

Each non-Claude registrar is gated by its host's existing detector (`isCursorInstalled`, `isCodexInstalled`, …) so registration is skipped for hosts the user hasn't installed. **Claude is the exception**: its `detected` flag mirrors `config.claudeEnabled !== false` (not a filesystem detector) — but MCP registration still runs **regardless of `claudeEnabled`** (it happens before the `claudeEnabled` hook gate in the install loop), because the Claude hook and MCP registration are independent decisions. IntelliJ MCP registration is a follow-up; the IntelliJ plugin registers no MCP today.

### MCP tool set and CLI↔MCP result parity

The `jolli mcp` server exposes ten tools (see `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` in [`cli/src/mcp/McpServer.ts`](cli/src/mcp/McpServer.ts)): four read tools `search`, `recall`, `get_decision_timeline`, `list_branches`; `get_pr_description` (build a PR title + body from the current branch) and `queue_status` (is summary generation still draining — call before `get_pr_description`); `status` (installation & configuration health — the MCP mirror of `jolli status`, wrapping `getStatus()`; reads the site from `config.jolliUrl` and never decodes the API key, so it stays clear of the CodeQL clear-text-logging gate); and three Jolli Space tools `bind_space`, `list_spaces`, `push_memory`. There is no `load_commits` tool.

`recall` (MCP) and `jolli recall --format json` (CLI) both call `resolveRecall()` ([`cli/src/core/RecallResolver.ts`](cli/src/core/RecallResolver.ts)), so they return the identical `type`-tagged union (`recall` | `catalog` | `error`), including catalog fuzzy-match on an unrecognized branch.

`search` (MCP) and `jolli search` (CLI) both call `searchHits()` ([`cli/src/core/SearchHits.ts`](cli/src/core/SearchHits.ts)), Orama BM25. Both return `{ hits }` — single-phase. The CLI `search` command's old two-phase catalog / `--hashes` flow was retired; [`LocalSearchProvider.ts`](cli/src/core/LocalSearchProvider.ts) is kept as an unused `SearchProvider` extension point.

The `jolli-recall` and `jolli-search` skill templates (written by [`SkillInstaller.ts`](cli/src/install/SkillInstaller.ts)) prefer the MCP tools (`mcp__jollimemory__recall` / `mcp__jollimemory__search`) and fall back to the CLI here-doc recipe for hosts without MCP support. `jolli-search` is intentionally lightweight (title / snippet / slug / hash; no decisions or recap) — point users to `jolli-recall` for depth.

### Site generation lives in a separate plugin package

The `jolli new` / `build` / `dev` / `start` / `convert` / `reverse` / `theme` commands are **not** in this repo. They live in `@jolli.ai/site-cli`, a plugin built and released separately. The host CLI discovers it at runtime through [`PluginLoader`](cli/src/PluginLoader.ts) and [`KnownPlugins.ts`](cli/src/KnownPlugins.ts) (allow-listed by random `jolliPluginId`, never by package name — see the PluginLoader header for the rationale).

When the plugin isn't installed, [`SiteCommandStubs.ts`](cli/src/commands/SiteCommandStubs.ts) is registered as a fallback by `registerMissingStubs(program, loadedPluginIds)` in `Api.ts main()`. The stubs keep the seven Site commands visible in `jolli --help` (grouped under "Jolli Site" by the help formatter) and emit a one-line install hint on invocation. There is no auto-install path — the stub prints `npm install -g @jolli.ai/site-cli` and exits non-zero.

Things to remember when working on plugin-adjacent code in this repo:

- **Adding a new known plugin** = one entry in `KNOWN_PLUGINS` in `KnownPlugins.ts` (id, packageName, installHint, optional `registerStub` callback). PluginLoader derives `KNOWN_PLUGIN_IDS` from this list, so the discovery allowlist updates automatically.
- **A plugin with no stub** is silently absent when missing — the user sees nothing in `--help` for it. Only plugins with a `registerStub` field appear when the package isn't installed. Both shipping plugins currently register stubs: `@jolli.ai/site-cli` ([`SiteCommandStubs.ts`](cli/src/commands/SiteCommandStubs.ts), grouped under "Jolli Site") and `@jolli.ai/space-cli` ([`SpaceCommandStubs.ts`](cli/src/commands/SpaceCommandStubs.ts), grouped under "Jolli Space").
- **Don't add `optionalDependencies` for plugins.** The host CLI has zero npm coupling to its plugins. Users `npm install -g` the host and the plugin separately; the plugin declares the host in its own `peerDependencies` (`>=` form, not `^`, so plugins survive host minor bumps).
- **Don't reintroduce `cli/src/site/`.** Anything site-rendering-related belongs in the plugin's repo, not here.
- **Three places consume the plugin's `jolliPluginId`** (host CLI in this repo, the plugin's `package.json`, and the plugin's CI release verification). Renaming an ID is fine — it's an opaque UUID, not a public name — but all three must be updated in lockstep.

### Auth & origin allowlist

`jolliApiKey` (`sk-jol-…`) is a plain or JWT-shaped token whose payload encodes the tenant URL in a base64url-decoded segment. Three places consume it: CLI (`cli/src/core/JolliApiUtils.ts`, canonical `parseJolliApiKey` + `assertJolliOriginAllowed`), VS Code extension (which imports the canonical CLI helpers via the bundled path), and the IntelliJ plugin (Kotlin port). The allowlist is `jolli.ai`, `jolli.dev`, `jolli.cloud`, `jolli-local.me`, HTTPS-only, with a suffix-boundary check (`host === h || host.endsWith("." + h)`). Validation is **save-time** (OAuth callback, `configure --set`, settings UI, `JOLLI_URL` env at read time) — request paths trust the saved value. Keep the three implementations in lockstep.

## Project conventions worth knowing

- **Biome** is the formatter and linter (config: [`cli/biome.json`](cli/biome.json)). Tabs, 4-wide, 120 column limit. Rules of note: `noExplicitAny: error`, `noUnusedImports/Variables: error`, `useImportType: warn`. CI runs `biome check --error-on-warnings` — warnings fail.

- **`intellij/` tests run in ONE JVM with JUnit 5 parallel class execution** (`intellij/src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties`, `maxParallelForks = 1`). That is only safe while no test mutates JVM-global state, so two rules are gated by `intellij/scripts/check-global-state.sh` (ratcheting baselines — they may only shrink): (1) production code never touches JVM globals (`System.out/err/in`, `System.getProperty/getenv`, bare `println`) outside `core/HookEnv.kt` — functions that need them take an `env: HookEnv = HookEnv()` parameter; (2) tests never call `System.setProperty/setOut/setErr/setIn`, `mockkStatic`, `mockkObject`, or `mockkConstructor` — build a fake env via `fakeHookEnv(...)` (test sources, `core/TestEnvs.kt`) and pass it in. Legacy offenders carry `@Isolated` until migrated; when you migrate one, drop the annotation and run `check-global-state.sh regen`.

- **Use `toForwardSlash` for `\` → `/` path normalization** ([`cli/src/core/PathUtils.ts`](cli/src/core/PathUtils.ts)); never inline `path.replace(/\\/g, "/")` or `path.split(sep).join("/")`. Forward-slash form is the [`StorageProvider.listFiles`](cli/src/core/StorageProvider.ts) contract and the input every downstream regex / prefix consumer expects — one forgotten inline normalization on Windows silently broke webview transcripts in production. The helper does **only** `\` → `/`: if you also need lowercasing or trailing-slash strip, use `normalizePathForCompare` instead. Biome cannot lint this pattern, so the rule is enforced socially — inline reintroduction is a review-blocker. Exempt: code already inside a domain helper that wraps the conversion (`normalizePathForCompare`, `normalizePathForMatch`, `toFileUrl`, `validateRelPath`); tests asserting on a specific separator; regexes whose `\\/g` is matching a literal backslash for non-path reasons.

- **Never include AI/Claude co-author information in commit messages.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailers, no "🤖 Generated with …" footers — for either commits or PR descriptions. The repo is going open-source and history should read as human-authored work; only `Signed-off-by:` is required.

(The DCO sign-off, `npm run all` gate, CLI coverage floor, and worktree-aware requirement are stated as critical rules at the top of this file; they are not repeated here to keep this file as a single source of truth.)

## Release flow

Releases for both **CLI** (`@jolli.ai/cli` on npm, tag prefix `release-cli-v`) and **VS Code extension** (`jolli.jollimemory-vscode` on VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX, tag prefix `release-vscode-v`) follow the same model. Each is triggered by manually running its publish workflow ([`publish-cli.yaml`](.github/workflows/publish-cli.yaml) / [`publish-vscode.yaml`](.github/workflows/publish-vscode.yaml)) with an existing signed tag as input — pushing the tag alone does not publish. Each minor has a long-lived `release/<minor>.x` branch shared by both artifacts; tags must be reachable from such a branch. Step-by-step commands and the full set of CI checks are in [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md). Four things aren't obvious from the workflow files:

- **Hotfixes do not bump main's version for the affected artifact.** When fixing a shipped version while main carries unfinished features, edit `<artifact>/package.json` only on `release/<minor>.x`. Main's `package.json` represents "what main would publish today" for that artifact — it stays at the previous version until main re-enters a shippable state. CLI and VS Code versions are independent, so hotfixing one does not require touching the other.
- **Cherry-picking a hotfix back to main excludes the version-bump commit.** Pick only the fix commit. Picking the `release: <artifact> <version>` bump commit too will drift main's version past what main can actually publish.
- **Tags must be signed via sigstore** (`git tag -s release-<artifact>-v…`, with [`gitsign`](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign) configured as the git signer — no long-lived key required). Both workflows verify with `gitsign verify` against an allowlist of OIDC identities. This is independent of, and in addition to, the DCO sign-off requirement on commits.
- **VS Code marketplace publishes are idempotent on retry.** `publish-vscode.yaml` checks each marketplace (VS Code, Open VSX) before publishing and **skips** the step if the version is already there. A run that succeeded on one marketplace and failed on the other can be retried with the same tag — the already-published one will be skipped, only the missing one will be attempted.
