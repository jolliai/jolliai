 *
 * Single source of truth for the human-readable row labels in the back-fill
 * candidate / result lists, shared by BOTH webview script builders (the sidebar
 * cold-start card and the Settings panel) so the wording never diverges.
 *
 * The functions here return **JavaScript source strings** that define row-label
 * helpers inside a webview's inlined `<script>` (these builders emit JS as
 * strings; there is no runtime module import in the webview). The same wording
 * is also exposed as real TS functions ({@link formatBackfillMeta} /
 * {@link formatBackfillResult}) so unit tests can assert on it directly without
 * evaluating the emitted script.
 *
 * Wording (confirmed with product): the preview shows how much real conversation
 * backs each commit — "N session(s) · M turn(s)" — NOT confidence/attribution
 * jargon. `turns` is `conversationTurns` (user-initiated, human-role entries),
 * never `transcriptEntries` (which counts AI/tool lines and reads inflated). A
 * commit with no attributed conversation shows "Code change only".
